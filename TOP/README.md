5/40 lessons for the javascript portion
37 lessons for the css and html portion
24 for node
13 for getting hired

117 lessons total
simple math
if I do one lesson a day then it will take me until 3/29 (unacceptable)

the goal is to complete this course within a month or less

meaning that each day should have benchmarks and there should be a number of completed courses per day...

which means that I should accomplish at least 4 lessons per day each day to have this course completed by the end of January


If I complete 5 lessons per day I will be finished with this course in 27.2 days || 1/31
